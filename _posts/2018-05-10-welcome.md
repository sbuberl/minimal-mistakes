Welcome to Steve's Stuff.  This will be a personal site about some of coding projects.
Probably going to add some styling soon.  I will post new releases and more documentation in the future.

I will also some new projects on here like my new programming language PX will have 
releases and docs on here as well when it's ready.

**NOTE** I also broke Reversi when I added to this design.
The code detecting which row and column is getting incorrect results.  I will
try to fix this at some point.
