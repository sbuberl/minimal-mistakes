# Flat-File SQL
Welcome to the home of Flat-File SQL! Flat-File SQL (or fSQL for short) is a way to use SQL queries without having another database (like mySQL) installed. It uses regular files that you store wherever you want. At the moment, there is only a PHP version, but a perl version and possibly other language ports are planned.

## Features and Benefits

There are several advantages to using fSQL over regular flat-files:

fSQL allows you to take advantage of SQL queries to easily manipulate and extract data without having to do it manually using the native file API.

fSQL has a fully object-oriented API in which the methods are similar to the mySQL API to avoid a lot of changes. This allows a program designed for mySQL to easily be ported to a flat-file system without any drastic changes.

fSQL supports all the essential SQL commands and mimics mySQL syntax and functions as well as features from the SQL Standard.
